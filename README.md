#### Hypothesis-testing effort to answer the question: 
Can we predict a country's total COVID-19 cases per million, on the basis of information about their perceptions of corruption?

#### Findings: 
While causation should certainly not be inferred on the basis of this investigation, the perceived corruption score does seem to capture something interesting, and perhaps seemingly unexpected at first, about a nation's ability (or, perhaps, willingess) to limit outbreaks. The notion that more corruption indicates fewer cases of COVID-19 per million does not appear to be very intuitive, so the argument for why this association deserves more attention is two-fold: 1) the idea that perceptions of corruption have anything to do with pandemic outcomes at all, and 2) the idea that greater perceived corruption appears to indicate fewer cases of COVID-19 per million). The case for an association is clear, but the need for an incorporation of more variables into this model appears necessary and appropriate. Ultimately, the presence of a link between perceived corruption scores and health outcomes during pandemics in a given country remains conceivable. Although we can not say much about causation in this case, it appears reasonable to view a link of this type as indirect in nature. However, given the great number of factors that typically generate macro-scale outcomes in social settings, the correlation of ~0.39 and inspection of the data under the null hypothesis, this model remains compelling, but is, most likely, incomplete.
